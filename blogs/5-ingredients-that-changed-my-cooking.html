      <p>Cooking can be a daunting task for many people, but with the right ingredients and mindset, it can become a fulfilling and enjoyable experience. Over time, I have discovered certain ingredients that have transformed my cooking and have made my dishes more delicious, flavorful, and fun to make. Here are five ingredients that have changed my cooking forever.</p>
      <div id="sec1"><img class="blog-header__image" src="/assets/images/blogs/5-ingredients-that-changed-my-cooking/chilli-oil.jpg"></div>
      <h3>Chili Oil</h3>
      <p>Chili oil: Chili oil is a condiment made from chili peppers, oil, and an array of spices. It adds a spicy kick to any dish and is perfect for those who love a bit of heat. I use it in stir-fries, eggs, pizza… honestly, it would be hard to find something I wouldn’t put chili oil on. A few drops of chili oil can transform a bland dish into something exciting and flavorful. I found that most dishes can benefit from even just a dash of chili oil because of the way it adds such a depth of rich flavor. One thing I really like about using chili oil is that depending on how much you use, it can either simply add depth to the flavors you’re already working with or can be the star of the show for a more basic meal. </p>
      <div id="sec2"><img class="blog-header__image" src="/assets/images/blogs/5-ingredients-that-changed-my-cooking/sesame-seed-oil.jpg" style="object-position: 0 12%;"></div>
      <h3>Sesame Seed Oil</h3>
      <p>Sesame seed oil: Sesame seed oil is a staple in Asian cuisine and is used to add nutty and toasty flavor to dishes. I use it in dressings, marinades, and stir-fries. A little bit goes a long way, and it can transform a simple dish into a rich and complex one. The first time I used sesame seed oil I was immediately surprised at just how much flavor you could smell even before adding it to the pan. That being said, too much of this oil can be a bit overwhelming for lighter dishes because of the depth of its flavor which has led me to combining it with normal cooking oil, but for a nice savory dish, this will transform the complexity of the flavors. I also love using sesame seed oil because of how easy it is to add. You don’t have to go out of your way because you’ll likely be using an oil anyway.</p>

      <h3>Chickpeas</h3>
      <p>Chickpeas (Garbanzo Beans): Chickpeas are awesome. They are a versatile legume that can be used in many dishes. They are rich in protein, fiber, and are a great source of iron. I use them in curries, stews, and salads. They are also perfect for making hummus, which is a great dip for vegetables and pita bread. I have found so many ways to prepare chickpeas and find myself adding them to so many of my dishes because they can fit in just about anywhere. Whether I’m roasting them for a nice crunch, blending them for a rich filling, or mashing them for a creamy spread, they add so much to my dishes. My favorite part about using chickpeas is that they can take the flavor of whatever you need them to. Just spice them however you see fit and they add an excellent, healthy texture to any dish.</p>

      <h3>Rosated Seed Mixes</h3>
      <p>Roasted seed mixes: Roasted seed mixes are a great way to add texture and flavor to dishes. I love adding them to salads, stir-fries, and wraps. They are a great source of protein, healthy fats, and fiber. I often make my own seed mix by roasting pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds to a hot pan and adding a pinch of salt and oil. Making your own seed mixes are great because they are super quick and cheap, and they also can sit in your pantry for a long time, ready for your next meal. Just roasting them for a minute or two unlocks amazing aromatics that literally smell healthy. The best part is you only have to do it every once in a while. I highly recommend trying out your own mixes to find what seeds you like best! I guarantee you that you’ll find yourself adding it to a ton of your meals.  </p>

      <h3>A Passion For Cooking (...seriously)</h3>
      <p>Passion for cooking: Ok, I know this sounds cliché, but the last and most important ingredient is passion for cooking. Cooking can be a therapeutic and relaxing activity. It is a way to express creativity and to nourish yourself and others while taking a break from the rest of your responsibilities. I know a lot of people dislike cooking, or even downright despise it, but whether it’s your passion or just something you have to do, it’s an excellent excuse to step away from work, a screen, or anything else going on and just spend time with yourself. It is also one of the few things in life where you can achieve immediate reward for your hard work. One thing I’ve found over my experiences with cooking is that once I found a few stable ingredients that would almost guarantee a tasty and healthy meal, I looked forward to being able to experiment with no stress. I love experimenting with new ingredients and flavors and have discovered that cooking is an endless source of inspiration and joy.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, these five ingredients have transformed my cooking and have made it an easier and more enjoyable experience. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced cook, adding ingredients like these to your pantry can elevate your dishes and inspire you to create new ones. Most importantly, don't forget to add a healthy dose of passion to everything you cook.</p>
